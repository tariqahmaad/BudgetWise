## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   Yarn or npm
*   Expo CLI: `npm install -g expo-cli`
*   A Firebase project set up. You will need to configure your Firebase credentials in the project. (Provide details on where to add firebase config, e.g., `firebase/firebaseConfig.js` - create this file if it doesn't exist and add it to `.gitignore`)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tariqahmaad/BudgetWise
    cd budgetwise
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Configure Firebase:**

    *   Create a `firebase/firebaseConfig.js` file (if it doesn't exist).

    *   Add your Firebase project configuration details to this file. It should look something like this:

        ```javascript
        // firebase/firebaseConfig.js
        const firebaseConfig = {
          apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
          authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
          projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
          storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
          messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
          appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
          measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID" // Optional
        };
        
        export default firebaseConfig;
        ```

    *   Ensure this file is listed in your `.gitignore` to keep credentials private.

4.  **(Optional) Environment Variables:**

    *   If you use environment variables (e.g., for API keys other than Firebase), create a `.env` file in the root directory and add them there.

    *   Example `.env` file:

        ```
        GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_GENAI_KEY
        ```

    *   Make sure `.env` is in your `.gitignore`.

### Running the Application

*   **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

    This will open the Expo Developer Tools in your browser.

*   **Run on an Android device/emulator:**
    Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your Android device, or press `a` in the terminal if an emulator is running.

    ```bash
    npm run android
    # or
    yarn android
    ```

*   **Run on an iOS simulator/device:**
    Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your iOS device, or press `i` in the terminal if a simulator is running (macOS only).

    ```bash
    npm run ios
    # or
    yarn ios
    ```

*   **Run in a web browser:**

    ```bash
    npm run web
    # or
    yarn web
    ```
