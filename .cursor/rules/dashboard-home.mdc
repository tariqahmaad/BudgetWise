# Dashboard HomeScreen Structure and Logic

## Main Entry Point
- The main dashboard view is implemented in [HomeScreen.js](mdc:Screens/Dashboard/HomeScreen.js).

## Key Components Used
- [MainCard.js](mdc:Components/CategoryCards/MainCard.js): Displays account/balance/income/savings cards.
- [SubCard.js](mdc:Components/CategoryCards/SubCard.js): Displays category spending cards.
- [NavigationBar.js](mdc:Components/NavBar/NavigationBar.js): Bottom navigation bar.
- [ScreenWrapper.js](mdc:Components/ScreenWrapper.js): Provides background and layout wrapper.

## Constants and Theme
- [theme.js](mdc:constants/theme.js): Provides COLORS and CATEGORY_ICONS used for styling and icon mapping.
- [Images.js](mdc:constants/Images.js): Default images, including profile avatar.

## Data and State Management
- Uses Firebase (see [firebaseConfig.js](mdc:firebase/firebaseConfig.js)) for:
  - User authentication (`auth`)
  - Firestore collections for accounts, categories, transactions, and friends
- State is managed with React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`).
- Real-time updates via Firestore `onSnapshot` for all user data collections.

## Main UI Sections
- **Profile Section**: Shows user avatar and name (from Firestore user doc).
- **Main Cards**: Horizontally scrollable cards for accounts, income trackers, and savings goals.
- **Friends List**: Horizontally scrollable, with add-friend modal.
- **Spending Categories**: Horizontally scrollable category cards, with spending totals calculated from transactions.
- **Transaction History**: Vertical list of recent transactions, sorted by date.

## Navigation
- Navigates to Profile, Add Debt, and (TODO) Friends/Categories/Transactions lists.

## Styling
- Uses a large StyleSheet at the bottom of [HomeScreen.js](mdc:Screens/Dashboard/HomeScreen.js) for layout and color consistency.

## Notes
- All data is user-specific, loaded from subcollections under the user's Firestore document.
- Handles loading and empty states for all major sections.
- Modal for adding friends is managed locally in HomeScreen state.
